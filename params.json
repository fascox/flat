Easily process flat files with Flat. Specify the format in a subclass of Flat::File and read and write until the cows come home.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nAdd this line to your application's Gemfile:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ngem 'flat'\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then execute:\r\n\r\n    $ bundle\r\n\r\nOr install it yourself as:\r\n\r\n    $ gem install flat\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nA simple example for a flat file class for grabbing information about\r\npeople might look like this:\r\n\r\n    # Actual plain text, flat file data, 29 bytes\r\n    #\r\n    #           10        20\r\n    # 012345678901234567890123456789\r\n    # Walt      Whitman   18190531\r\n    # Linus     Torvalds  19691228\r\n\r\n    class People < Flat::File\r\n\r\n      add_field :first_name, width: 10, filter: :trim\r\n      add_field :last_name,  width: 10, filter: ->(v) { v.strip }\r\n      add_field :birthday,   width: 8,  filter: BirthdayFilter\r\n      pad       :autoname,   width: 2\r\n\r\n      def self.trim(v)\r\n        v.strip\r\n      end\r\n\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    p = People.new\r\n\r\n    p.each_record(open('somefile.dat')) do |person|\r\n\r\n      puts \"First Name: #{person.first_name}\"\r\n      puts \"Last Name : #{person.last_name}\"\r\n      puts \"Birthday : #{person.birthday}\"\r\n\r\n      puts person.to_s\r\n    end\r\n\r\nConsult the [RDocs](http://rubydoc.info/github/juicyparts/flat) for additional examples, and information on Filters and\r\nFormatters.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n1.
